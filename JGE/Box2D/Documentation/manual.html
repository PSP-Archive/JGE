<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div class = "text">
<p>Box2D is a 2D rigid body simulator for games. You can use it in your game to make objects move in believable ways and make the world seem more interactive. From the game's point of view a physics engine is just a system for procedural animation. Rather than paying (or begging) an animator to move your actors around, you can let Sir Isaac Newton do the directing.</p>

<p>Box2D is written in portable C++. Most of the types defined in the engine begin with the <b>b2</b> prefix. Hopefully this is sufficient to avoid name clashing with your game engine.</p>
</div>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<div class = "text">
<p>In this manual I'll assume you are familiar with basic physics concepts, such as mass, force, torque, and impulses. If not, please first consult the many tutorials provided by Chris Hecker and David Baraff (google these names). You do not need to understand their tutorials in great detail, but they do a good job of laying out the basic concepts that will help you use Box2D.</p>

<p><a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> is also an excellent source of physics and mathematics knowledge. In some ways it is more useful than Google, because it has carefully crafted content.</p>

<p>This is not a prerequisite, but if you are curious about the about the inner workings of Box2D, you can look at these <a href="http://www.gphysics.com/files/GDC2007_ErinCatto.zip">slides</a>.</p>
</div>

<h1>Core Concepts</h1>
<div class = "text">
<p>Box2D works with several fundamental objects. We briefly define these objects here and more details are given later in this document.</p>

<dl>
<dt>rigid body</dt>
<dd>A chunk of matter that is so strong that the distance between any two bits of matter on the chunk is completely constant. They are hard like a diamond. In the following discussion we use <em>body</em> interchangably with rigid body.</dd>
<dt>shape</dt>
<dd>A 2D piece of collision geometry that is fixed to a rigid body.
<dt>constraint</dt>
<dd>A constraint is a physical connection that removes degrees of freedom from bodies. In 2D a body has 3 degrees of freedom. If we take a body and pin it to the wall (like a pendulum) we have <em>constrained</em> the body to the wall. At this point the body can only rotate about the pin, so the constraint has removed 2 degrees of freedom.</dd>
<dt>contact constraint</dt>
<dd>A special constraint designed to prevent penetration of rigid bodies and to simulate friction. You will never create a contact constraint, they are created automatically by Box2D.</dd>
<dt>joint</dt>
<dd>This is a contraint used to hold two or more bodies together. Box2D supports these joint types: revolute, prismatic, distance, and more. Joints may support <b>limits</b> and <b>motors</b>.</dd>
<dt>joint limit</dt>
<dd>A joint limit restricts the range of motion of a joint. For example, the human elbow only allow a certain range of motion.</dd>
<dt>joint motor</dt>
<dd>A joint motor drives the motion of the connected bodies according to the joint's degrees of freedom. For example, you can use a motor to drive the rotation of an elbow.</dd>
<dt>world</dt>
<dd>A physics world is a collection of bodies, shapes, and constraints that interact together. Box2D supports the creation of multiple worlds, but this is usually not necessary.</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<h1>Hello Box2D</h1>
<div class = "text">
<p>In the distribution of Box2D is a <em>Hello World</em> project. The program creates a large ground box and a small dynamic box. This code does not contain any graphics, so prepare to be underwelmed. :)</p>

<h2>Creating the World (of Box2D)</h2>
<p>Every Box2D program begins with the creation of a world object. This is the physics hub that manages memory, objects, and simulation.</p>
<p>To create a world object, first we need to define a bounding box for the world. Box2D uses the bounding box to accelerate collision detection. The size isn't critical, but a better fit will improve performance. It is better to make the box too big than to make it too small.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2AABB worldAABB;
    worldAABB.minVertex.Set(-100.0f, -100.0f);
    worldAABB.maxVertex.Set(100.0f, 100.0f);
</pre>
<p>Next we define the gravity vector. Yes, you can make gravity go sideways (or you could just rotate your monitor). Also we tell the world to allow bodies to sleep when they come to rest. A sleeping body doesn't require any simulation.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2Vec2 gravity(0.0f, -10.0f);
    bool doSleep = true;
</pre>
<p>Now we create the world object. Normally you would create the world on the heap and store the pointer in one of your game structures. However, creating the world on the stack works fine in this example.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2World world(worldAABB, gravity, doSleep);
</pre>
<p>So now we have our physics world, let's start adding some stuff to it.</p>

<h2>Creating a Ground Box</h2>
<p>Bodies are built using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a shape with geometry, friction, density, etc.</li>
<li>Define a body with a shape list, position, velocity, etc.</li>
<li>Use the world object to create a body.</li>
</ol>
<p>So now we create a ground box definition. The data in definitions are copied by Box2D, so you can create these on the stack or cook them into your game structures. This allows you to use instancing of shape data. Here is the ground box definition.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2BoxDef groundBoxDef;
    groundBoxDef.extents.Set(50.0f, 10.0f);
    groundBoxDef.density = 0.0f;
</pre>
<p>The <em>extents</em> is just a vector of the box's half widths. So in this case the ground box is 100 units wide (x-axis) and 20 units tall (y-axis). Box2D is tuned for meters, kilograms, and seconds. So you can consider the extents to be in meters. However, it is possible to change unit systems, as discussed later in this document</p>
<p>The density is specified as zero. If all the shapes attached to a body have zero density, then the body is treated as static.</p>
<p>Now we create the ground body. For this we need a <em>body definition</em>. With the body definition we specify the initial position of the body and its shape list. In this case there is just one shape.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2BodyDef groundBodyDef;
    groundBodyDef.position.Set(0.0f, -10.0f);
    groundBodyDef.AddShape(&groundBoxDef);
</pre>
<p>The body definition is passed onto the world object to create the ground body.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2Body* ground = world.CreateBody(&groundBodyDef);
</pre>
<p>Again, Box2D does not keep a reference to the shape or body definitions. It copies the data into the <code>b2Body</code> structure.</p>
<p>Note that every shape must have a parent body, even shapes that are static. However, you can attach all static shapes to a single static body. This need for static bodies is done to make the Box2D code more uniform internal, reducing the number of potential bugs. A that's a good thing.</p>
<p>You might notice a pattern here. Most Box2D types are prefixed with <code>b2</code>. This is done to reduce the chance for naming conflicts with your code.</p>

<h2>Creating a Dynamic Body</h2>
<p>So now we have a ground body. We can use the same technique to create a dynamic body. The main difference, besides dimensions, is that the box shape's density is greater than zero. This makes Box2D treat the body as dynamic. Here is the code to create the dynamic box.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2BoxDef boxDef;
    boxDef.extents.Set(1.0f, 1.0f);
    boxDef.density = 1.0f;
    boxDef.friction = 0.3f;
    b2BodyDef bodyDef;
    bodyDef.position.Set(0.0f, 4.0f);
    bodyDef.AddShape(&boxDef);
    b2Body* body = world.CreateBody(&bodyDef);
</pre>
<p>That's it for initialization. We are now ready to begin simulating.</p>

<h2> Simulating the World (of Box2D)</h2>
<p>So we have initialized the ground box and a dynamic box. Now we are ready to set Newton loose to do his thing. We just have a couple more things to consider.</p>
<p>Box2D uses a bit of numerical code called an <em>integrator</em>. Integrators simulation the physics equations at discrete points of time. This goes along with the traditional game loop where we essentially have a flip book of movement on the screen. So we need to pick a time step for Box2D. Generally physics engines for games like a time step at least as fast as 60Hz or 1/60 seconds. You can get away with larger time steps, but you will have to be more careful about setting up the definitions for your world. We also don't like the time step to change much. So don't tie the time step to your frame rate (unless you really, really have to). If you decide to do this, drop me a note in the forums because you will need to make some modifications to Box2D. Without further ado, here is the time step.</p>
<pre class="code">
    float32 timeStep = 1.0f / 60.0f;
</pre>
<p>In addition to the integrator, Box2D also uses a larger bit of code called a <em>constraint solver</em>. The constraint solver solves all the constraints in the simulation, one at a time. A single constraint can be solved perfectly. However, when we solve one constraint, we slightly disrupt other constraints. To get a good solution, we need to iterate over all constraints a number of times. The suggested iteration count for Box2D is 10. You can tune this number to your liking, just keep in mind that this has a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Using fewer iterations increases performance but accuracy suffers. Likewise, using more iterations decreases performance but improves the quality of your simulation. Here is our chosen iteration count.</p>
<pre class="code">
    int32 iterations = 10;
</pre>
<p>We are now ready to begin the simulation loop. In your game the simulation loop can be merged with your game loop. In each pass through your game loop you call <code>b2World::Step</code>. Just one call is usually enough, depending on your frame rate and your physics time step.</p>
<p>The Hello World program was designed to be dead simple, so it has no graphical output. Rather that being utterly boring by producing no output, the code prints out the position and rotation of the dynamic body. Yay! Here is the simulation loop that simulates 60 time steps for a total of 1 second of simulated time.</p>
<pre class="code">
    for (int32 i = 0; i < 60; ++i)
    {
        world.Step(timeStep, iterations);
        b2Vec2 position = body->GetOriginPosition();
        float32 rotation = body->GetRotation();
        printf("%4.2f %4.2f %4.2f\n", position.x, position.y, rotation);
    }
</pre>

<h2>Cleanup</h2>
<p>When a world leaves scope or is deleted by calling <code>delete</code> on a pointer, all the memory reserved for bodies and joints is freed. This is done to make your life easier. However, you will need to nullify any body or joint pointers you have because they will become invalid.</p>
</div>

<h1>API Design</h1>
<div class = "text">
<h2>Memory Management</h2>
<p>A large number of the decisions about the design of Box2D were based on the need for quick and efficient use of memory. In this section I will discuss how and why Box2D allocates memory.</p>

<p>
Box2D tends to allocate a large number of small objects (around 50-300 bytes). Using the system heap through <code>malloc</code> or <code>new</code> for small objects is inefficient and can cause fragmentation. Many of these small objects may have a short life span, such as contacts, but can persist for several time steps. So we need an allocator that can efficiently provide heap memory for these objects.</p>
<p>
Box2D's solution is to use a <em>small block</em> allocator (SBA). The SBA keeps a number of growable pools of varying sizes. When a request is made for memory, the SBA returns a block of memory that best fits the requested size. When a block is freed, it is returned to the pool. Both of these operations are fast and cause little heap traffic.
</p>
<p> Since Box2D uses a SBA, you should never <em>new</em> or <em>malloc</em> a body or joint. The only Box2D object that you allocate yourself is a <code>b2World</code>. The <code>b2World</code> class provides factories for you to create bodies and joints. This allows Box2D to use the SBA and hide the gory details from you. Never, ever, call <code>delete</code> or <code>free</code> on a body or joint.
</p>
<p> While executing a time step, Box2D needs some temporary workspace memory. For this, it uses a stack allocator to avoid per-step heap allocations. You don't need to interact with the stack allocator, but it's good to know it's there.</p>

<h2>Factories and Definitions</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, memory management plays a central role in the design of the Box2D API. So when you create a <code>b2Body</code> or a <code>b2Joint</code>, you need to call the factory functions on <code>b2World</code>.</p>
<p>There are creation functions:</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2Body* b2World::CreateBody(const b2BodyDef* def)
    b2Joint* b2World::CreateJoint(const b2JointDef* def)
</pre>
<p>And there are corresponding destruction functions:</p>
<pre class="code">
    void b2World::DestroyBody(b2Body* body)
    void b2World::DestroyJoint(b2Joint* joint)
</pre>
<p>When you create a body or joint, you need to provide a <em>definition</em> or <em>def</em> for short. These definitions contain all the information needed to build the body or joint. By using this approach we can prevent construction errors, keep the number of function parameters small, provide sensible defaults, and reduce the number of accessors.</p>

<h2>User Data</h2>
<p>The <code>b2Shape</code>, <code>b2Body</code>, and <code>b2Joint</code> classes allow you to attach user data as a <code>void*</code>. This is handy when you are examining Box2D data structures and you want to determine how they relate to the data structures in your game engine.</p>

<p>For example, it is typical to attach an <em>actor</em> pointer to the rigid body on that actor. This sets up a circular reference. If you have the actor, you can get the body. If you have the body, you can get the actor.</p>
<pre class="code">
    GameActor* actor = GameCreateActor();
    b2BodyDef bodyDef;
    bodyDef.userData = actor;
    actor->body = box2Dworld->CreateBody(&bodyDef);
</pre>

<p>Here are some examples of cases where you would need the user data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applying damage to an actor using a collision result.</li>
<li>Playing a scripted event if the player is inside an axis-aligned box.</li>
<li>Accessing a game structure when Box2D notifies you that a joint is going to be destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that user data is optional and you can put anything in it. However, you should be consistent. For example, if you want to store an actor pointer on one body, you should keep an actor pointer on all bodies. Don't store an actor pointer on one body, and a foo pointer on another body. This will likely lead to a crash if you try to cast an actor pointer into a foo pointer.</p>

<h2>Dealing with C++</h2>
<p>C++ is great for capsulation and polymorphism, but it's not so great for API design. There are always significant trade-offs when creating a C++ library.</p>

<p>Should we use abstract factories or the <em>pimpl</em> idiom? These make the API look cleaner, but they ultimately get in the way of debugging and efficient development.</p>

<p>Should we use private data and friends as necessary? Perhaps, but eventually the number of friends can become ridiculous.</p>

<p>Should we just wrap the C++ code with a C-API? Perhaps, but this is extra work and may lead to internal choices that are non-optimal. Also, C-APIs are harder to debug and maintain. A C-API also breaks encapsulation.</p>

<p>For Box2D I have chosen the path of least resistance. For some cases a class is well contained in its design and function, so I use public functions and private data. For everything else I use structs with all public members. These choices let me develop the code rapidly, it is easy to debug, and it creates minimal internal clutter while maintaining tight encapsulation. The downside is that you don't see a clean, simple API.</p>

<h2>Strawman</h2>
<p>If you don't like this API design, that's ok! You have the source code! Seriously, if you have feedback about anything related to Box2D, please drop a note in the <a href="http://www.box2d.org/forum">forum</a>.</p>

</div>

<h1>World</h1>
<div class = "text">
<p>The <code>b2World</code> class contains the bodies and joints. It manages all aspects of the simulation and allows for asynchronous queries (like AABB queries). Much of your interactions with Box2D will be with a <code>b2World</code> object.</p>

<h2>Creating and Destroying a World</h2>
<p>Creating a world is fairly simple. You need to provide a bounding box and a gravity vector.</p>
<p>The axis-aligned bounding box should encapsulate the world. You can improve performance by making the bounding box a bit bigger than your world, say 2x just to be safe. If you have lots of bodies that fall into the abyss, your should detect this and remove the bodies. This will improve performance and prevent floating point overflow.</p>
<p>To create and destory a world you need to use <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2World* myWorld = new b2World(aabb, gravity, doSleep);
    ... do stuff ...
    delete myWorld;
</pre>

<h2>Using a World</h2>
<p>The world class contains factories for creating and destroying bodies and joints. These factories are discussed later in the sections on bodies and joints. There are some other interactions with <code>b2World</code> that I will cover now.</p>

<h3>Simulation</h3>
<p>The world class is used to drive the simulation. You specify a time step and an iteration count. For example:</p>
<pre class="code">
    float32 timeStep = 1.0f / 60.f;
    int32 iterationCount = 10;
    myWorld->Step(timeStep, iterationCount);
</pre>
<p>After the time step you can examine your bodies and joints for information. Most likely you will grab the position off the bodies so that you can update your actors and render them. You can perform the time step anywhere in your game loop, but you should be aware of the order of things. For example, you must create bodies before the time step if you want to get collision results for the new bodies in that frame.</p>
<p>As I discussed above in the HelloWorld tutorial, you should use a fixed time step. By using a larger time step you can improve performance in low frame rate scenarios. But generally you should use a time step no larger than 1/30 seconds. A time step of 1/60 seconds will usually deliver a high quality simulation.</p>
<p>The iteration count controls how many times the constraint solver sweeps over all the contacts and joints in the world. More iterations always yields a better simulation. But don't trade a small time step for a large iteration count. 60Hz and 10 iterations is far better than 30Hz and 20 iterations.</p>

<h3>Exploring the World</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, the world is a container for bodies, joints, and contacts. You can grab the body, joint, contact lists off the world and iterate over them. For example, this code wakes up all the bodies in the world:</p>
<pre class="code">
    for (b2Body* b = myWorld->GetBodyList(); b; b = b->GetNext())
    {
        b->WakeUp();
    }
</pre>

<h3>AABB Queries</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to determine all the shapes in a region. The <code>b2World</code> class has a fast log(N) method for this using the <em>broad phase</em> data structure. You provide an AABB in world coordinates and <code>b2World</code> returns an array of all the shapes that potentially intersect the AABB. This is not exact because what the function actually does is return all the shapes whose AABBs intersect the specified AABB. For example, the following code finds all the shapes that potentially intersect a specified AABB and wakes up all of the associated bodies.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2AABB aabb;
    aabb.minVertex.Set(-1.0f, -1.0f);
    aabb.maxVertex.Set(1.0f, 1.0f);
    const int32 k_bufferSize = 10;
    b2Shape *buffer[k_bufferSize];
    int32 count = b2World->Query(aabb, buffer, k_bufferSize);
    for (int32 i = 0; i < count; ++i)
    {
        buffer[i]->GetBody()->WakeUp();
    }
</pre>

</div>

<h1>Shapes</h1>
<div class = "text">
<p>Shapes are the collision geometry attached to bodies. Shapes are also used to define the mass of a body. This lets you specify the density and let Box2D do the work of computing the mass properties.</p>
<p>Shapes have properties of friction and restitution. Shapes carry collision filtering information to let you prevent collisions between some of your game objects.</p>
<p>Shapes are always owned by a body. You can attach multiple shapes to a single body. Shapes are abstract classes so that many types of shapes can be implemented in Box2D. If you are brave, you can implement your own shape type (and collision algorithms). So how are shapes defined?</p>

<h2>The Shape Definition</h2>
<p>Shapes do not exist on their own and you cannot create a shape directly. Instead you specify a <em>shape definition</em> that contains all the construction data for a shape. Then you attached the shape definition to a body definition, which in turn is used to create a body. When the body is created the body definition is examined for shape definitions and the corresponding shapes are created and attached to the new body. This may seem a bit convoluted, but it really makes life easier, for me and you.</p>
<p>Box2D supports three types of shape definitions: circles, boxes, and convex polygons. Internally, Box2D creates a convex polygon for boxes. This simplifies the collision code. I encourage you to look at <code>b2Shape.h</code> for all the shape definition parameters. But don't worry, I will cover most of them here.</p>
<p>Box2D does not keep a pointer to your shape definitions. Instead Box2D copies all the data out of the shape definition. So you can create shape definitions on the stack and you can use a single shape definition to spawn multiple shape instances. A caveat is that the user data on the shape definition would be shared by multiple shapes, which is often not desirable.</p>

<h3>Local Position and Rotation</h3>
<p>Every shape is attached to a body and you are free to attach a shape with any position and rotation. In the shape definition you specify the local position and local rotation that will be used to attach the shape to the body. This really comes in handy when you have have <em>compound shapes</em>.</p>
<p>Compounds shapes are multiple shapes that share the same body. An example is a dumbbell with a circle on each end. The following code snippet shows how to setup shape definitions for a dumbbell.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2CircleDef circle1, circle2;
    circle1.localPosition.Set(-1.0f, 0.0f);
    circle2.localPosition.Set(1.0f, 0.0f);
    b2BodyDef bodyDef;
    bodyDef.AddShape(&circle1);
    bodyDef.AddShape(&circle2);
</pre>
<p>You don't need to worry about compound shapes colliding with each other. Box2D automatically ignores collisions between shapes on the same body.</p>

<h3>Friction and Restitution</h3>
<p>Friction is used to make objects slide along each other realistically. Box2D supports static and dynamic friction, but uses the same parameter for both. Friction is simulated accurately in Box2D and the friction strength is proportional to the normal force (this is called <em>Coulomb friction</em>). The friction parameter is usually set between 0 and 1. A value of zero turns off friction and a value of one makes the friction strong. When the friction is computed between two shapes, Box2D must combine the friction parameters of the two shapes. This is done with the following formula:</p>
<pre class="code">
    float32 friction;
    friction = sqrtf(shape1->friction * shape2->friction);
</pre>

<p>Restitution is used to make objects bounce. The restitution value is usually set to be between 0 and 1. Consider dropping a ball on a table. A value of zero means the ball won't bounce. This is called an <em>inelastic</em> collision. A value of one means the ball's velocity will be exactly reflected. This is called a <em>perfectly elastic</em> collision. Restitution is combined using the following formula.</p>
<pre class="code">
    float32 restitution;
    restitution = b2Max(shape1->restitution, shape2->restitution);
</pre>

<p>When a shape develops multiple contacts, restitution is simulated approximately. This is because Box2D uses an iterative solver. Box2D also uses inelastic collisions when the collision velocity is small. This is done to prevent jitter.</p>

<h3>Density</h3>
<p>Box2D computes the mass and rotational inertia of bodies using the mass distribution implied by the attached shapes. Specifying mass values directly can often lead to poorly tuned simulations. Therefore, the mass density per unit area is specified in the shape definition. You can override mass values in <code>b2Body</code>, but there is currently no API for this.</p>

<h3>Collision Filtering</h3>
<p>Collision filtering is a system for preventing collision between shapes. For example, say you make a character that rides a bicycle. You want the bicycle to collide with the terrain and the character to collide with the terrain, but you don't want the character to collide with the bicycle (because they must overlap). Box2D supports such collision filtering using categories and groups.</p>
<p>Box2D supports 16 collision categories. For each shape you can specify which category it belongs to. You also specify what other categories this shape can collide with. For example, you could specify in a multiplayer game that all players don't collide with each other and monsters don't collide with each other, but players and monsters should collide. This is done with <em>masking bits</em>. For example:</p>
<pre class="code">
    playerShapeDef.categoryBits = 0x0002;
    monsterShapeDef.categoryBits = 0x0004;
    playerShape.maskBits = 0x0004;
    monsterShapeDef.maskBits = 0x0002;
</pre>

<p>Collision groups let you specify an integral group index. You can have all shapes with the same group index always collide (positive index) or never collide (negative index). Group indices are usually used for things that are somehow related, like the parts of a bicycle. In the following example, shape1 and shape2 always collide, but shape3 and shape4 never collide.</p>
<pre class="code">
    shape1Def.groupIndex = 2;
    shape2Def.groupIndex = 2;
    shape3Def.groupIndex = -8;
    shape4Def.groupIndex = -8;
</pre>
<p>Collisions between shapes of different group indices are filtered according the category and mask bits. In other words, group filtering has higher precendence than category filtering.</p>

<p>Note that additional collision filtering occurs in Box2D. Here is a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>shapes on static bodies never collide</li>
<li>shapes on the same body never collide</li>
<li>your can optionally enable/disable collision between bodies connected by a joint</li>
</ul>

<h3>Circle Definitions</h3>
<p><code>b2CircleDef</code> extends <code>b2ShapeDef</code> and adds a radius. The origin of a circle is its center.</p>

<h3>Box Definitions</h3>
<p><code>b2BoxDef</code> extends <code>b2ShapeDef</code> and adds an extents vector. Assuming the y-axis is up in your game, the extents vector is defined this way:</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2BoxDef boxDef;
    boxDef.extents.x = width / 2.0f;
    boxDef.extents.y = height / 2.0f;
</pre>
<p>The origin of a box is its center.</p>
<p>Internally, Box2D does not implement a box shape. Instead, a box definition is used to create a convex polygon.</p>

<h3>Polygon Definitions</h3>
<p><code>b2PolyDef</code> is used to implement convex polygons. They are a bit tricky to use correctly, so please read closely. The maximum vertex count is defined by <code>b2_maxPolyVertices</code> which is currently 8. If you need to use more vertices, you must modify <code>b2_maxPolyVertices</code> in <code>b2Settings.h</code>.</p>
<p>When you build a polygon definition you must specify the number of vertices you will use. The vertices must be specified in <b>counter-clockwise</b> (CCW) order. Also, the polygon must be <b>convex</b>. In other words, each vertex must point outwards to some degree. Finally, you must not overlap any vertices. Box2D will automatically close the loop.</p>
<p>A future version of Box2D will provide a tool to automatically create a convex polygon from a set of points, so you won't have to be so careful.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a polygon definition of a triangle:</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2PolyDef triangleDef;
    triangleDef.vertexCount = 3;
    triangleDef.vertices[0].Set(-1.0f, 0.0f);
    triangleDef.vertices[1].Set(1.0f, 0.0f);
    triangleDef.vertices[2].Set(0.0f, 2.0f);
</pre>
<p>The polygon vertices should generally be centered around the origin, but this is not necessary. The origin of the polygon shape is defined implicitly by its vertices.</p>

<h2>(Not) Creating and Destroying a Shape</h2>
<p>We don't need to discuss shape creation or destruction because this is handled automatically by Box2D. You should never try to create or destory a shape. You should never hold onto a shape pointer, because the body may be removed somewhere else in your game code.</p>
<p>You can let shape definitions go out of scope because Box2D copies the data. Box2D does not hold a reference to your shape definitions. This lets you recycle shape definitions as you create bodies.</p>

<h2>Using a Shape</h2>
<p>There's not much to say here. You can get a shape's type, its parent body, and its world position. You can also test a point to see if it is contained within the shape. Look at <code>b2Shape.h</code> for details.</p>
</div>

<h1>Bodies</h1>
<div class = "text">
<p>Bodies have position and velocity. You can apply forces, torques, and impulses to bodies.</p>
<p>Bodies are the backbone for shapes. Bodies carry shapes and move them around in the world. Bodies are always <em>rigid bodies</em> in Box2D. That means that two shapes attached to the same rigid body never move relative to each other.</p>
<p>Bodies hold the mass of its shapes. You usually keep pointers to all the bodies you create. This way you can query the body positions to update the positions of your graphical entities. You should also keep body pointers so you can destroy them when you are done with them.</p>

<h2>The Body Definition</h2>
<p>Before a body is created you must create a body definition (<code>b2BodyDef</code>). You can create a body definition on the stack or build it into your game's data structures. The choice is up to you.</p>
<p>Box2D only copies the data out of the body definition, it does not keep a pointer to the body definition. This means you can recycle a body definition to create multiple bodies.</p>
<p>Lets go over some of the key members of the body definition.</p>

<h3>Adding Shapes</h3>
<p>Shape definitions are added to body definitions. This way a body and its shapes are created all at once in the world's body factory. The maximum number of shapes per body is <code>b2_maxShapesPerBody</code> which currently has a value of 64. If you need to add mores shapes per body, then modify <code>b2_maxShapesPerBody</code> in <code>b2Settings.h</code>.</p>
<p>The body definition holds a pointer to the shape definition. This means the shape definition must not go out of scope while the body definition is being used. The upside is that you can reuse the same body definition to create multiple bodies and you can modify the shape definition parameters to suit without adding them to the body definition again.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2CircleDef circleDef;
    circleDef.radius = 1.0f;
    b2BodyDef bodyDef;
    bodyDef.AddShape(&circleDef);
</pre>

<h3>Position and Rotation</h3>
<p>The body definition gives you the chance to initialize the position of the body on creation. This has better performance than creating the body at the world origin and then moving the body.</p>
<p>A body has two main points of interest. The first point is the body's <em>origin</em>. The bodies origin is defined implicitly by the shapes it holds. Recall that shape definitions hold a local position. This local position is relative the body's origin. The second point of interest is the <em>center of mass</em>. The center of mass is determined from mass distribution of the attached shapes. Internally Box2D works with the center of mass position, but remembers the location of the body origin.</p>
<p>When you are building the body definition, you may not know where the center of mass is located. Therefore you specify the position of the body's origin. You may also specify the body's rotation, which is not affected by the position of the center of mass.</p>
<img src="images/bodyOrigin.gif" class="figure"/><br/>
<p>Consider a body made of two boxes. The boxes are arranged in an upside-down T configuration. The first box is placed at the body origin, so its local position and rotation are zero. The second box actually has the same extents as the first box, but it has been moved up the y-axis and rotated 90 degrees. When the body is created, Box2D determines that the center of mass is halfway between the two box centers (0, 0.75). Here is code that produces this body:</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2BoxDef box1;
    box1.extents.Set(2.0f, 1.0f);
    b2BoxDef box2;
    box2.extents.Set(2.0f, 1.0f);
    box2.localPosition.Set(0.0f, 1.5f);
    box2.localRotation = b2_pi / 2.0f;
    b2BodyDef bodyDef;
    bodyDef.AddShape(&box1);
    bodyDef.AddShape(&box2);
</pre>
<p>Now would be a good time to read this section again. It's tricky stuff that you should probably understand.</p>

<h3>Velocity</h3>
<p>You can set the initial velocity of the body in the body definition. This is purely for convenience because you can set a body's velocity any time you like.</p>
<p>Usually you should not set a body's velocity to constrain its motion. To constraint a body, use joints, shapes, forces, and impulses.</p>
<p>When you are building a body definition you may not know the position of the body's center of mass, therefore the initial linear velocity is applied to the body's origin.</p>

<h3>Damping</h3>
<p>Damping is used to reduce the world velocity of bodies. Damping is different than friction because damping occurs with contact and damping is much cheaper to simulate than friction. However, damping is not a replacement for friction and the two effects should be used together.</p>
<p>Damping only works well for fixed time steps. If you need to vary the time step you will need to modify the code. Please visit the forums and ask for help.</p>
<p>Damping parameters should be between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning no damping, and 1 meaning full damping. Normally you will use a damping value between 0 and 0.1. I generally do not use linear damping because it makes bodies look <em>floaty</em>.</p>
 <pre class="code">
    bodyDef.linearDamping = 0.0f;
    bodyDef.angularDamping = 0.01f;
</pre>

<h3>Sleep Parameters</h3>
<p>What does sleep mean? Well it is expensive to simulate bodies, so the less we have to simulate the better. When a body comes to rest we would like to stop simulating it.</p>
<p>When Box2D determines that a body (or group of bodies) has come to rest, the body enters a sleep state which has very little CPU overhead. If an awake body collides with a sleeping body, then the sleeping body wakes up. Bodies will also wake up if a joint or contact attached to them is destroyed. You can also wakeup a body manually.</p>
<p>The body definition lets you specify whether a body can <em>sleep</em> and whether a body is created sleeping.</p>
 <pre class="code">
    bodyDef.allowSleep = true;
    bodyDef.isSleeping = false;
</pre>

<h2>Creating and Destroying a Body</h2>
<p>Bodies are created and destroyed using a body factory provided by the world class. This lets the world create the body with an efficient allocator and embed the body in its data structures.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2Body* body = myWorld->CreateBody(&bodyDef);
    ... do stuff ...
    myWorld->DestroyBody(body);
    body = NULL;
</pre>
<p><em>Never</em> use <code>new</code> or <code>malloc</code> to create a body. The world won't know about the body and the body won't be properly initialized.</p>
<p>Box2D does not keep a reference to the body definition or any of the data it holds (except user data pointers).</p>
<p>Box2D allows you to avoid destroying bodies by deleting your <code>b2World</code> object, which does all the cleanup work for you. However, you should be mindful to nullify and body pointers that you keep in your game engine.</p>
<p>When you destroy a body all its attached shapes, joints, and contacts are destroyed. This is called <em>implicit destruction</em>. Any body connected to one of those joints and/or contacts is woken. There is mostly very convenient for you. However, you must be aware of one crucial issue:</p>
<blockquote>
When a body is destroyed, any joints attached to the body are automatically destroyed. You must nullify any pointers you have to those joints. Otherwise, your program will <b>die horribly</b> if you try to destroy that joint later.
</blockquote>
<p>To help you nullify your joint pointers, Box2D provides a listener class named <code>b2WorldListener</code> that you can implement and provide to your world object. Then the world object will notify you when a joint is going to be implicity destroyed.</p>

<h2>Static and Dynamic Bodies</h2>
<p>Bodies that move around are called <em>dynamic</em> and bodies that are fix are called <em>static</em>. Both static and dynamic bodies can have shapes. If you use the default shape density of 0, then you will get a static body, otherwise you'll get a dynamic body.</p>
<p>In principle, you could use a single static body for your world by attaching possibly many shapes to it. This will not improve performance much, but it can save a bit of memory. The choice is yours. The maximum number of shapes per body is determined by <code>b2_maxShapesPerBody</code> which has a default value of 64.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to connect a dynamic body to ground with a joint. You'll need to connect the joint to a static body. If you don't have a static body, you can get a shared static body from your world object.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2Body* ground = myWorld->GetGroundBody();
    ... build a joint using the ground body ...
</pre>

<h2>Using a Body</h2>
<p>Using a body is fairly straightforward. You can set and get the position and rotation of a body. You can set and get the position of the body's origin or its center of mass.  You can set and get its velocities.</p>
<pre class="code">
    void SetOriginPosition(const b2Vec2& position, float32 rotation);
    b2Vec2 GetOriginPosition() const;

    void SetCenterPosition(const b2Vec2& position, float32 rotation);
    b2Vec2 GetCenterPosition() const;

    float32 GetRotation() const;
    const b2Mat22& GetRotationMatrix() const;

    void SetLinearVelocity(const b2Vec2& v);
    b2Vec2 GetLinearVelocity() const;

    void SetAngularVelocity(float32 w);
    float32 GetAngularVelocity() const;
</pre>

<p>You can apply forces, torques, and impulses to a body. When you apply a force or an impulse, you provide a world point where the load is applied. This often results in a torque about the center of mass.</p>
<pre class="code">
    void ApplyForce(const b2Vec2& force, const b2Vec2& point);
    void ApplyTorque(float32 torque);
    void ApplyImpulse(const b2Vec2& impulse, const b2Vec2& point);
</pre>

<p>Keep in mind that the only body function that wakes it is <code>b2Body::WakeUp</code>. Applying forces <b>does not</b> wake a body. This is done so that bodies under static load can sleep. For example, you may wish to increase the gravity on a body by applying a steady downward force. There is no reason to prevent this body from going to sleep. If you want to apply a force to a body and ensure that it reacts, you must wake the body <em>first</em>.</p>

<p>The body class has some utility functions to help you transform points and vectors between local and world space. If you don't understand these concepts, please read "Essential Mathematics for Games and Interactive Applications" by Jim Van Verth and Lars Bishop. These functions are efficient, so use them with impunity.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2Vec2 GetWorldPoint(const b2Vec2& localPoint);
    b2Vec2 GetWorldVector(const b2Vec2& localVector);
    b2Vec2 GetLocalPoint(const b2Vec2& worldPoint);
    b2Vec2 GetLocalVector(const b2Vec2& worldVector);
</pre>

<p>You can iterate over a body's shapes. This is useful if you want to draw collision geometry in a debug mode.</p>
<pre class="code">
    for (b2Shape* s = body->GetShapeList(); s; s = s->GetNext())
    {
        GameDrawShape(s);
    }
</pre>

</div>

<h1>Joints</h1>
<div class = "text">
<p>Joints are used to constrain bodies to the world or to each other. Typical examples in games include ragdolls, teeters, and pulleys. Joints can be combined in many different ways to create interesting motions.</p>
<p>Some joints provide limits so you can control the range of motion. Some joint provide motors which can be used to drive the joint at a prescribed speed until a prescribed force/torque is exceeded.</p>
<p>Joint motors can be used in many ways. You can use motors to control position by specifying a joint velocity that is proportional to the difference between the actual and desired position. You can also use motors to simulate joint friction: set the joint velocity to zero and provide a small, but significant maximum motor force/torque. Then the motor will attempt to keep the joint from moving until the load becomes too strong.</p>

<h2>The Joint Definition</h2>
<p>Each joint type has a definition that derives from <code>b2JointDef</code>. All joints are connected between two different bodies. One body may static. If you want to waste memory, then create a joint between two static bodies. :)</p>
<p>You can specify user data for any joint type and you can provide a flag to prevent the attached bodies from colliding with each other. This is actually the default behavior and you must set the <code>collideConnected</code> Boolean to allow collision between to connected bodies.</p>
<p>The rest of the joint definition data depends on the joint type. We cover these now.</p>

<h3>Distance Joint</h3>
<p>One of the simplest joint is a distance joint which says that the distance between two points on two bodies must be constant. When you specify a distance joint the two bodies should already be in place. Then you specify the two <em>anchor</em> points in world coordinates. The first anchor point is connected to body 1, and the second anchor point is connected to body 2. These points imply the length of the distance constraint.</p>
<img src="images/distanceJoint.gif" class="figure"/><br/>
<p>Here is an example of a distance joint definition. In this case we decide to allow the bodies to collide and we place the anchor points at the respective center of mass positions.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2DistanceJointDef jointDef;
    jointDef.body1 = myBody1;
    jointDef.body2 = myBody2;
    jointDef.collideConnected = true;
    jointDef.anchorPoint1 = myBody1->GetCenterPosition();
    jointDef.anchorPoint2 = myBody2->GetCenterPosition();
</pre>

<h3>Revolute Joint</h3>
<p>A revolute joint forces two bodies to share a common anchor point, often called a <em>hinge point</em>. The revolute joint has a single degree of freedom: the relative rotation of the two bodies. This is called the <em>joint angle</em>.</p>
<img src="images/revoluteJoint.gif" class="figure"/><br/>
<p>To specify a revolute you need to provide two bodies and a single anchor point in world space. Box2D assumes that the bodies are already in the correct position.</p>
<p>In this example, two bodies are connected by a revolute joint at the first body's center of mass.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2RevoluteJointDef jointDef;
    jointDef.body1 = myBody1;
    jointDef.body2 = myBody2;
    jointDef.anchorPoint = myBody1->GetCenterPosition();
</pre>
<p>The revolute joint angle is positive when body2 rotates CCW about the anchor point. Like all angles in Box2D, the revolute angle is measured in radians. By convention the revolute joint angle is zero when the joint is created, regardless of the current rotation of the two bodies.</p>
<p>In some cases you might wish to control the joint angle. For this, the revolute joint can optionally simulate a joint limit and/or a motor.</p>
<p>A joint limit forces the joint angle to remain between an lower and upper bound. The limit will apply as much torque as needed to make this happen. The limit range should include zero, otherwise the joint will lurch when the simulation begins.</p>
<p>A joint motor allows you to specify the joint speed (the time derivative of the angle). The speed can be negative or positive. A motor can have infinite force, but this is usually not desirable. Have you ever heard the expression:</p>
<blockquote>"What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object?"</blockquote>
<p>I can tell you it's not pretty. So you can provide a maximum torque for the joint motor. The joint motor will maintain the specified speed unless the required torque exceeds the specified maximum. When the maximum torque is exceeded, the joint will slow down and can even reverse.</p>
<p>You can use a joint motor to simulate joint friction. Just set the joint speed to zero, and set the maximum torque to some small, but significant value. The motor will try to prevent the joint from rotating, but will yield to a significant load.</p>
<p>Here's a revision of the revolute joint definition above; this time the joint has a limit and a motor enabled. The motor is setup to simulate joint friction.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2RevoluteJointDef jointDef;
    jointDef.body1 = myBody1;
    jointDef.body2 = myBody2;
    jointDef.anchorPoint = myBody1->GetCenterPosition();
    jointDef.lowerAngle = -0.5f * b2_pi; // -90 degrees
    jointDef.upperAngle = 0.25f * b2_pi; // 45 degrees
    jointDef.enableLimit = true;
    jointDef.motorTorque = 10.0f;
    jointDef.motorSpeed = 0.0f;
    jointDef.enableMotor = true;
</pre>

<h3>Prismatic Joint</h3>
<p>A prismatic joint allows for relative translation of two bodies along a specified local axis. A prismatic joint prevents relative rotation. Therefore, a prismatic joint has a single degree of freedom.</p>
<img src="images/prismaticJoint.gif" class="figure"/><br/>
<p>The prismatic joint definition is similar to the revolute joint description; just substitute translation for angle and force for torque. Using this analogy proved an example prismatic joint definition with a joint limit and a friction motor:</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2PrismaticJointDef jointDef;
    jointDef.body1 = myBody1;
    jointDef.body2 = myBody2;
    jointDef.anchorPoint = myBody1->GetCenterPosition();
    jointDef.lowerTranslation = -5.0f;
    jointDef.upperTranslation = 2.5f;
    jointDef.enableLimit = true;
    jointDef.motorForce = 1.0f;
    jointDef.motorSpeed = 0.0f;
    jointDef.enableMotor = true;
</pre>
<p>Like the revolute joint, the prismatic joint translation is zero when the joint is created. So be sure zero is between your lower and upper translation limits.</p>

<h3>Pulley Joint</h3>
<p>A pulley is used to create an idealized pulley. The pulley connects two bodies to ground and to each other. As one body goes up, the other goes down. The total length of the pulley rope is conserved according to the initial configuration.</p>
<blockquote>
    length1 + length2 == constant
</blockquote>
<img src="images/pulleyJoint.gif" class="figure"/><br/>
<p>You can supply a ratio that simulates a <em>block and tackle</em>. This causes one side of the pulley to extend faster than the other. At the same time the constraint force is smaller on one side than the other. You can use this to create mechanical leverage.</p>
<blockquote>
    length1 + ratio * length2 == constant
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if the ratio is 2, then length1 will vary at twice the rate of length2. Also the force in the rope attached to body1 will have half the constraint force as the rope attached to body2.</p>
<p>Pulleys can be troublesome when one side is fully extended. The rope on the other side will have zero length. At this point the constraint equations become singular (bad). Therefore the pulley joint constrains the maximum length that either side can attain. Also, you may want to control the maximum lengths for gameplay reasons. So the maximum lengths improve stability and give you more control.</p>
<p>Here is an example pulley definition:</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2Vec2 p1 = myBody1->GetCenterPosition();
    b2Vec2 p2 = myBody2->GetCenterPosition();
    b2PulleyJointDef jointDef;
    jointDef.body1 = myBody1;
    jointDef.body2 = myBody2;
    jointDef.anchorPoint1 = p1;
    jointDef.anchorPoint2 = p2;
    jointDef.groundPoint1.Set(p1.x, p1.y + 10.0f);
    jointDef.groundPoint2.Set(p2.x, p2.y + 12.0f);
    jointDef.ratio = 1.0f;
    jointDef.maxLength1 = 18.0f;
    jointDef.maxLength2 = 20.0f;
</pre>

<h3>Gear Joint</h3>
<p>If you want to create a sophisticated mechanical contraption you might want to use a gears. In priciple you can create gears in Box2D by using compound shapes to model gear teeth. This is not very efficient and might be tedious to author. You also have to be careful to line up the gears so the teeth mesh smoothly. Box2D has a simpler method of creating gears: the <em>gear joint</em>.</p>
<img src="images/gearJoint.gif" class="figure"/><br/>
<p>The gear joint requires the you have two bodies connected to ground by a revolute or prismatic joint. You can use any combination of those joint types. Also, Box2D requires that the revolute and prismatic joints were created with the ground as body1.</p>
<p>Like the pulley ratio, you can specify a gear ratio. However, in this case the gear ratio can be negative. Also keep in mind that when one joint is a revolute joint (angular) and the other joint is prismatic (translation), then the gear ratio with have units of length or one over length.</p>
<blockquote>
    coordinate1 + ratio * coordinate2 == constant
</blockquote>
<p>Here is an example gear joint:</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2GearJointDef jointDef;
    jointDef.body1 = myBody1;
    jointDef.body2 = myBody2;
    jointDef.joint1 = myRevoluteJoint;
    jointDef.joint2 = myPrismaticJoint;
    jointDef.ratio = 2.0f * b2_pi / myLength;
</pre>
<p>Note that the gear joint depends on two other joints. This creates a fragile situation. What happens if those joints are deleted?</p>
<blockquote>
Always delete gear joints before the revolute/prismatic joints on the gears. Otherwise your code will crash in a bad way due to the orphaned joint pointers in the gear joint. You should also delete the gear joint before you delete any of the bodies involved.
</blockquote>

<h3>Mouse Joint</h3>
<p>The mouse joint is used to drag bodies around in the test-bed. It will probably be revised in the future, so I will not go into details about this joint yet.</p>

<h2>Creating and Destroying a Joint</h2>
<p>Joints are created and destroyed using the world factor methods. This brings up an old issue:</p>
<blockquote>Don't try to create a body or joint on the stack or on the heap using <code>new</code> or <code>malloc</code>. You must create and destroy bodies and joints using the create and destroy methods of the <code>b2World</code> class.</blockquote>
<p>Here's an example of the lifetime of a revolute joint:</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2RevoluteJointDef jointDef;
    jointDef.body1 = myBody1;
    jointDef.body2 = myBody2;
    jointDef.anchorPoint = myBody1->GetCenterPosition();
    b2RevoluteJoint* joint = myWorld->CreateJoint(&jointDef);
    ... do stuff ...
    myWorld->DestroyJoint(joint);
    joint = NULL;
</pre>
<p>It is always good to nullify your pointer after they are destroyed. This will make the program crash in a controlled manner if you try to reuse the pointer.</p>

<h2>Orphaned Joints</h2>
<p>The lifetime of a joint is not simple. Heed this warning well:</p>
<blockquote>Joints are destroyed when an attached body is destroyed. You should implement a <code>b2WorldListener</code> class so that you can nullify your joint pointers when they are implicitly destroyed.</blockquote>
<p>This precaution is not always necessary. You may organize your game engine so that joints are always destroyed before the attached bodies. In this case you don't need to implement the listener class.</p>

<h2>Using a Joint</h2>
<p>Many simulations create the joints and don't access them again until they are detroyed. However, there is a lot of useful data contained in joints that you can use to create a rich simulation.</p>
<p>First of all, you can get the bodies, anchor points, and user data from a joint.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2Body* GetBody1();
    b2Body* GetBody2();
    b2Vec2 GetAnchor1();
    b2Vec2 GetAnchor2();
    void* GetUserData();
</pre>
<p>All joints have a reaction force and torque. This the reaction force applied to body 2 at the anchor point. You can use reaction forces to break joints or trigger other game events. You must provide the inverse time step to get the reaction forces because Box2D stores the reaction impulses. These functions may do some computations, so don't call them if you don't need the result.</p>
<pre class="code">
    b2Vec2 GetReactionForce(float32 invTimeStep);
    float32 GetReactionTorque(float32 invTimeStep);
</pre>

<h3>Using a Distance Joint</h3>
<p>Distance joints don't have motors, so there are no extra runtime methods for distance joints.</p>

<h3>Using a Revolute Joint</h3>
<p>You can access a revolute joint's angle, speed, and motor torque.</p>
<pre class="code">
    float32 GetJointAngle() const;
    float32 GetJointSpeed() const;
    float32 GetMotorTorque(float32 invTimeStep) const;
</pre>
<p>You also update the motor parameters each step.</p>
<pre class="code">
    void SetMotorSpeed(float32 speed);
    void SetMotorTorque(float32 torque);
</pre>
<p>Joint motors have some interesting abilities. You can update the joint speed every time step so you can make the joint move back-and-forth like a sine-wave or according to whatever function you want.</p>
<pre class="code">
    ... Game Loop Begin ...
    myJoint->SetMotorSpeed(cosf(0.5f * time));
    ... Game Loop End ...
</pre>
<p>You can also use joint motors to track a desired joint angle. For example:</p>
<pre class="code">
    ... Game Loop Begin ...
    float32 angleError = myJoint->GetJointAngle() - angleTarget;
    float32 gain = 0.1f;
    myJoint->SetMotorSpeed(-gain * angleError);
    ... Game Loop End ...
</pre>
<p>Generally your gain parameter should not be too large. Otherwise your joint may become unstable.</p>

<h3>Using a Prismatic Joint</h3>
<p>Using a prismatic joint is similar to using a revolute joint. Here are the relevant member functions:</p>
<pre class="code">
    float32 GetJointTranslation() const;
    float32 GetJointSpeed() const;
    float32 GetMotorForce(float32 invTimeStep) const;
    void SetMotorSpeed(float32 speed);
    void SetMotorForce(float32 force);
</pre>

<h3>Using Pulley Joints</h3>
<p>Pully joints provide the current lengths.</p>
<pre class="code">
	float32 GetLength1() const;
	float32 GetLength2() const;
</pre>

<h3>Using Gear Joints</h3>
<p>Gear joints don't provide any information beyond the functions defined in <code>b2Joint</code>.</p>

</div>

<h1>Contacts</h1>
<div class = "text">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Contacts are objects created by Box2D to manage collision between shapes. There are different kinds of contacts, derived from <code>b2Contact</code>, for managing contact between different kinds of shapes. For example there is a contact class for managing polygon-polygon collision and another contact class for managing circle-circle collision. This is normally not important to you, I just thought you might like to know.</p>

<p>Here is some terminlogy associated with contacts. This terminology is particular to Box2D, but you might find similar terminology in other physics engines.</p>
<dl>
<dt>contact</dt>
<dd>An object that manages contact between a pair of shapes over a number of time steps. A contact object is present while the two shapes' axis-aligned bounding boxes overlap.</dd>
<dt>contact manifold</dt>
<dd>A contact object will create contact manifold objects when the shape pair actually touches. A manifold has a single normal vector and up to two contact points. The idea is that there is some one dimensional region where the two convex 2D shapes overlap. Multiple manifolds are possible when a convex shape collides with a non-convex shape (like a line segment soup).</dd>
<dt>contact point</dt>
<dd>A contact point belongs to a contact manifold and position, separation, impulses, and a feature based id. The contact's normal vector is held in it's parent manifold.</dd>
<dt>contact separation</dt>
<dd>Separation is the opposite of penetration. Separation is negative when shapes overlap. You can assume that Box2D will only have contact points with zero or negative separation.</dd>
<dt>contact impulses</dt>
<dd>Box2D use a <em>Sequential Impulse</em> solver and stores the results with the contact points. You can safely use the impulse values to guage the collision intensity. For example, you can use the impulses to trigger breakables or to play collision sounds.</dd>
<dt>contact ids</dt>
<dd>Box2D tries to use the contact impulses from one time step as the initial guess for the next time step. Box2D uses contact ids to match contact points across time steps. The ids contain geometric features indices that help to distinguish one contact point from another.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Contacts are created when two shape's AABBs overlap. Sometimes collision filtering will prevent the creation of contacts. Box2D sometimes needs to create a contact even though the collision is filtered. In this case it uses a <code>b2NullContact</code> that prevents collision from occuring. Contacts are destroyed with the AABBs cease to overlap.</p>

<p>So you might gather that there may be contacts created for shapes that are not touching (just their AABBs). Well, this is correct. It's a "chick or egg" problem. We don't know if we need a contact object until one is created to analyze the collision. We could delete the contact right away if the shapes are not touching, or we can just wait until the AABBS stop overlapping. Box2D takes the latter approach.</p>

<h2>Contact Callbacks</h2>
<p>Box2D has a simple approach to contact callbacks: it doesn't have any. Why is this? Well, Box2D stores all the contact points across time steps, so you can access the data any time you like. Normally, you will look at contact points after a time step.</p>

<p>As you traverse the contact objects, you might decide to destroy a body. For example, when a vehicle hits a wall, you might want to destroy the wall. Normally, this creates a buggy situation because the contact object you are processing needs to be destroyed when you destroy one of the bodies involved. Box2D has a solution for this problem.</p>

<blockquote>
Box2D does not destroy bodies immediately. When you destroy a body, Box2D removes it from the world body list and adds it to a deferred destruction list. The body is actually destroyed the next time you call <code>b2World::Step</code>.
</blockquote>

<h2>Processing Contacts</h2>
<p>Here is a snippet from the test <code>CollisionProcessing</code>. The code iterates over all the contacts and for shapes that are touching, it will destroy the lighter parent body. Note that with Box2D's deferred body destruction, the same body might be destroyed more than once.</p>
<pre class="code">
for (b2Contact* c = m_world->GetContactList(); c; c = c->GetNext())
{
    if (c->GetManifoldCount() > 0)
    {
        b2Body* body1 = c->GetShape1()->GetBody();
        b2Body* body2 = c->GetShape2()->GetBody();
        float32 mass1 = body1->GetMass();
        float32 mass2 = body2->GetMass();

        if (mass1 > 0.0f && mass2 > 0.0f)
        {
            if (mass2 > mass1)
            {
                m_world->DestroyBody(body1);
                body1 = NULL;
            }
            else
            {
                m_world->DestroyBody(body2);
                body2 = NULL;
            }
        }
    }
}
